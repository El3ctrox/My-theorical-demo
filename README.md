# This repository
  Formerly this repository was a game scripted together with my framework (02/2022 - 10/2022), testing in practice all tools and concepts of this framework. While i writing this game, i realized that this framework is so complex, buggy, hard to debugging and bad networking performance, then this framework has been discontinued.
  But i think this is a good demonstration of my ability to create a more different API, using several roblox functions, optimizing readability and execution performance, and a little bit about how i structure my projects and my security knowledge.

# Testing
  Recently i fixing some bugs and finished some mechanics for this game to be played and tested. Since this game requires a few assets, i put the place in this repository, and the published game link here [Roblox Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/3715675497/Skyblock-attempt-3)

# This repository
Formerly this repository was a game scripted together with my framework (02/2022 - 10/2022), testing in practice all tools and concepts of this framework. While i wrote this game, i realized that this framework is so complex, buggy, hard to debugging and bad networking performance. Then this framework has discontinued, but i think this is a good showcase of my capability to create a more different API, using several roblox functions, optimizing readability and execution performance, and a bit about how i structure my projects.

# Testing
Recently i fixing some bugs and finished some mechanics for this game to be played and tested. Since this game requires a few assets, i left the place in this repository, and the published game link here [Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/3715675497/Skyblock-attempt-3)
